# icare4old_crosswalks
MDS-interRAI crosswalk developed in the I-CARE4OLD project

The R function icode_transform() converts MDS 2.0 data into interRAI i-code (Suite) standard,
using crosswalk tables produced in the I-CARE4OLD project.

In addition to this code, you need:
 - the crosswalk tables
 - MDS 2.0 data with standard MDS variable names
